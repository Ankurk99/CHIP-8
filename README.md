# CHIP-8 emulator

## What is an emulator ?
An emulator is a computer program that mimics the internal design and functionality of a computer system (System A). It allows users to run software designed for this specific system (Sytem A) on a totally different computer system or architecture (System B).
## What is Chip-8
CHIP-8 is an interpreted programming language, developed by Joseph Weisbecker. It was initially used on the COSMAC VIP and Telmac 1800 8-bit microcomputers in the mid-1970s. CHIP-8 programs are run on a CHIP-8 virtual machine. Games written in the Chip 8 language could easily run on systems that had a Chip 8 interpreter.

## Why this project ?
This project is made for educational and learning purpose. The main aim was to better understand how the CPU works and how machine code is executed. Due to small number of opcodes (35 in total for Chip 8 ) and the fact that a lot of instructions are used in more advanced CPUs, this project is a good start for beginners.
